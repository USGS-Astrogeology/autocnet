    This JSON file is used to find the appropriate default ISIS translation file for a given
    (SpacecraftName, InstrumentId) combination. When appending this dictionary, the SpacecraftName
    and InstrumentId should be a modified version of the expected values for these keywords in an
    ISIS cube. The modifications are added in an attempt to simplify look up, since variations
    exist for some missions and instruments. The modifications are: (1) all lowercase
    (2) all spaces and underscores removed. 


serial_numbers.py
    Created 2016/02/10 - Jeannie Backer
    This script is used to copy the highest version of ISIS translation files from the ISIS data
    area to the autocnet area. The copied files are renamed to include the mission directory name
    and to exclude the original version number so the JSON dictionary doesn't have to be updated
    every time a translation file version is increased. These files have also been modified from
    the orginals by removing the 'Auto' flags since they are not needed and the python pvl reader
    does not know how to parse them.
