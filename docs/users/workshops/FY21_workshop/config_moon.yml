    # The name of the database to connect to.  Tables will be created inside this DB.
    name: '' # This needs to be all lowercase for PostGreSQL!
    # The number of seconds to wait while attemping to connect to the DB.
    timeout: 500

env:
    conda: '/usgs/cpkgs/anaconda3_linux/envs/autocnet_updated'  # The name of a conda environment to initialize for cluster jobs 
    ISISROOT: '/usgs/cpkgs/anaconda3_linux/envs/isis3.9.0'  # PATH to the ISISROOT directory

### Pfeffernusse / CSM Configuration ###
pfeffernusse:
    # URL to the service that serves CSM compliant ISDs
    url: 'http://pfeffer.wr.usgs.gov/v1/pds'

### Redis Configuration ###
redis:
    # Name of the redis queue. Ensure it is unique to avoid multiple uses
    # of the same redis queue.
    basename: 'kag_rgM'
    # Hostname (or localhost) where the redis server is running
    host: 'autocnet.wr.usgs.gov'
    # Port that redis is accepting connections on
    port: '30009'
    # The name of the queue that successful job messages are pushed. This
    # name should be unique to avoid collision with other users.
    completed_queue: 'kag_rgM:done'
    # The name of the queue used for jobs that need to be started. This
    # name should be unique to avoid collision with other users.
    processing_queue: 'kag_rgM:proc'
    # The name of the queue that currently processing jobs are pushed to. This
    # name should be unique to avoid collision with other users.
    working_queue: 'kag_rgM:working'

### Spatial Reference Setup ###
spatial:
    # The name of the target body that will be output in ISIS control networks.
    target: 'MOON'
    # The following two values need to be added to the database that is storing
    # the spatial information.
    #
    # The spatial reference identifier for latitudinal geometries in the database.
    latitudinal_srid: 930100
    # The spatial reference identifier for rectangular geometries in the database.
    rectangular_srid: 930180
    # The radii of the body. If the body is a sphere, these values should match.
    # Units are in meters
    semimajor_rad: 1737400
    semiminor_rad: 1737400
    # A compliant proj4 string. Checkout http://spatialreference.org for examples
    # for planetary bodies.
    proj4_str: '+proj=longlat +a=1737400 +b=1737400 +no_defs'
    # DEM used to generate height values for projection
    dem: '/work/projects/kaguya/TOPO/Lunar_LRO_LOLAKaguya_DEMmerge_60N60S_512ppd_radius.cub'
    # dem: '/usgs/cpkgs/isis3/isis_data/base/dems/ldem_128ppd_Mar2011_clon180_radius_pad.cub'
