    "# AutoCNet Intro\n",
    "AutoCNet is a suite of functions that parallelize network generation and analyze the health of networks. Networks within AutoCNet are represented with an [undirected graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)), called a NetworkCandidateGraph. AutoCNet leverages a database for presistent storage of the images, points, and measures of a network. The use of this database allows for quick access of each elements geometries and how those geometries relate with one another. "
